# RunningPlanBuilder

*Read this in other languages: [Deutsch](README.de.md)*

A simple tool to graphically create and edit running plan templates.

With the help of the tool, existing templates can be imported, edited and exported.\
New running schedules can be created in the same way.\
The templates are generated in JSON format and can then be used in the ["RunningPlan"](https://github.com/hiroladev/RunningPlan) app.

This application use the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) design pattern 
with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/).

## Usage

The app was developed in the [Java](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java-Technologie) programming language and uses the [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) libraries for the graphic components.\
To use the app, you therefore need a so-called runtime environment and the components of JavaFX.

I provide further downloads on my website (german only).\
For Windows there is a download with the required runtime environment as a [ZIP archive](https://www.hirola.de/content/perma?id=243).\
The program (EXE) can be started directly (from the folder) after unpacking.

You will also find a (smaller) [EXE file](https://www.hirola.de/content/perma?id=249) there, which, however, requires an installed runtime environment and JavaFX components.
Such a free Java Runtime (JRE) with the JavaFX components can be found e.g. at [Bellsoft](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=Windows).
